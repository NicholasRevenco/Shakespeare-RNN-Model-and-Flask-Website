{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vtJt-SLgDPOG"},"source":["# Flask Website\n","\n","This code outlines the implementation of a Flask web application hosted on a Google Colab notebook. It begins by installing necessary packages and importing essential libraries, including Flask and TensorFlow. After defining the location of HTML templates and loading a pre-trained TensorFlow model, the application is made publicly accessible via ngrok. It then sets up a function for generating predictions based on user input, defining routes to handle both GET and POST requests. When a user submits input via the webpage, the input is processed through the defined prediction function, and the resulting prediction is displayed on the webpage. The code reflects a robust integration of machine learning with web development, facilitating user interaction with a predictive model through a web interface."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":35180,"status":"ok","timestamp":1691365035166,"user":{"displayName":"Nicholas Revenco","userId":"17387816628556923243"},"user_tz":420},"id":"8sVDmmiEi6m-","outputId":"5b9549ed-9d80-4bd3-fa88-45ddb6d63486"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Collecting flask_ngrok\n","  Downloading flask_ngrok-0.0.25-py3-none-any.whl (3.1 kB)\n","Requirement already satisfied: Flask>=0.8 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from flask_ngrok) (2.2.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: requests in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from flask_ngrok) (2.27.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: Werkzeug>=2.2.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from Flask>=0.8->flask_ngrok) (2.3.6)\n","Requirement already satisfied: Jinja2>=3.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from Flask>=0.8->flask_ngrok) (3.1.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: itsdangerous>=2.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from Flask>=0.8->flask_ngrok) (2.1.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: click>=8.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from Flask>=0.8->flask_ngrok) (8.1.6)\n","Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<1.27,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->flask_ngrok) (1.26.16)\n","Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->flask_ngrok) (2023.7.22)\n","Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer~=2.0.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->flask_ngrok) (2.0.12)\n","Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->flask_ngrok) (3.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: MarkupSafe>=2.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from Jinja2>=3.0->Flask>=0.8->flask_ngrok) (2.1.3)\n","Installing collected packages: flask_ngrok\n","Successfully installed flask_ngrok-0.0.25\n","Collecting pyngrok==4.1.1\n","  Downloading pyngrok-4.1.1.tar.gz (18 kB)\n","  Preparing metadata (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","Requirement already satisfied: future in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from pyngrok==4.1.1) (0.18.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: PyYAML in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from pyngrok==4.1.1) (6.0.1)\n","Building wheels for collected packages: pyngrok\n","  Building wheel for pyngrok (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","  Created wheel for pyngrok: filename=pyngrok-4.1.1-py3-none-any.whl size=15963 sha256=f4f90c52437873dc54bf1f3b1fe5c708fca7b1a2ef431b5a7063d72b00144660\n","  Stored in directory: /root/.cache/pip/wheels/4c/7c/4c/632fba2ea8e88d8890102eb07bc922e1ca8fa14db5902c91a8\n","Successfully built pyngrok\n","Installing collected packages: pyngrok\n","Successfully installed pyngrok-4.1.1\n","Authtoken saved to configuration file: /root/.ngrok2/ngrok.yml\n"]}],"source":["# Install the flask_ngrok package, which allows you to run Flask applications from Google Colab notebooks\n","!pip install flask_ngrok\n","\n","# Install a specific version of pyngrok\n","!pip install pyngrok==4.1.1\n","\n","# Add your ngrok authtoken, this is necessary to create a tunnel for the Flask app\n","# For example, your line should look like: !ngrok authtoken 1234567890_qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\n","!ngrok authtoken\n","\n","# Import the necessary Python libraries\n","import os\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","from flask import Flask, render_template, request\n","from flask_ngrok import run_with_ngrok\n","from google.colab import drive"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"NSKbdTpyDfXJ"},"source":["This portion of the code prepares the environment to run a Flask web application in a Google Colab notebook.
